# IIIF project: The Pyrgi Tablets

This project was created for the course "English: The Language of Computer Science" given by Mr. Edward J. Gray (Ph. D.) at the Ecole nationale des chartes for the "master 2 technologies numériques appliquées à l'Histoire". 

The images used are private photographd taken at the Villa Giulia of Rome during the Summer of 2021. The Pyrgi Tablets (c. 500 BCE) are three gold sheets discovered in 1964 at Pyrgi during archaeological excavations led by Massimo Pallottino. Written both in Etruscan and in Phoenician, they largely helped our understanding of the Etruscan language.

The project followed Glen Robson's [IIIF Tutorial](https://training.iiif.io/iiif-online-workshop/index.html). This repository was created thanks to Workbench.
